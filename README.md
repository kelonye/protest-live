### Idea

Mobile friendly map-based crowdsource of resources that could be used during peaceful protests. The geospatial data is stored on-chain in [Geohash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash) boxes for later easier retrieval. Anyone with a Near account can register a useful location that could be of aid during protests. The frontend is primarily mobile based. You can check it out on your phone over [here](https://protest-live.surge.sh).
